# Sharding bibliography

This repository collects existing peer-reviewed publications on sharding, from the distributed transaction perspective. It aims at boosting the research on sharding for permissionless blockchains.

We classify these publications according to their designated functionalities as below. All publications are sorted chronologically.

- Crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) data store
- CFT transaction store
- Byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) Atomic Commit Protocols (ACP)
- Blockchain sharding
